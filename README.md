# 📞 AI Spam Call Detection 
An AI-powered system to automatically detect spam calls based on conversation transcripts. This project compares Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to determine the most stable and efficient model for spam detection. 

## 🚀 Project Overview 
Spam calls are disruptive and potentially harmful to users. This project aims to build an intelligent classification system that can: 
- Detect whether a call is **Spam** or **Legitimate Call** 
- Provide **real-time prediction via API** 
- Store prediction history in a database 

## 🧠 Models Implemented 
1️⃣ TF-IDF + XGBoost 

2️⃣ GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) 

## 📊 Model Evaluation Evaluation metrics: 
- Accuracy 
- Precision 
- Recall 
- F1-Score 
- ROC-AUC 

## ✨ Features
- Spam vs Legitimate call classification
- Real-time prediction via REST API
- Probability score output
- Prediction history logging (SQLite)
- Model comparison (XGBoost vs GRU)
- Modular backend architecture

### 🔎 Key Findings 
- **XGBoost demonstrated the most stable performance**, especially on imbalanced datasets. 
- **GRU showed signs of overfitting** due to limited dataset size. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack 
- Python 
- FastAPI 
- Streamlit (UI Demo) 
- XGBoost 
- TensorFlow / Keras (GRU) 
- Scikit-learn 
- SQLite 
- Uvicorn
